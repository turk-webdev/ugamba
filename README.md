## Build instructions
Can be run using local npm scripts:

## My Contributions
* Creating all classes & queries involved in cards & decks for the game
* Built the win checker (adapted from if-less solution found online)
* Refactored some of the main game action handler controller
* Created all routes & controllers responsible for initializing cards to decks and decks to games
* Created all routes & controllers responsible for dealing cards to players & resetting after games ended
* Helped build much of the back-end and logic processing for the game
